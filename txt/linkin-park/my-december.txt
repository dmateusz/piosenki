This is my december 
 This is my time of the year 
 This is my december 
 This is all so clear 
 This is my december 
 This is my snow covered home 
 This is my december 
 This is me alone 

 And I just wish that 
 I didn't feel like there was 
 Something I missed 
 And I take back all 
 The things I said 
 To make you 
 Feel like that 
 And I just wish that 
 I didn't feel 
 Like there was 
 Something i missed 
 And I take back all the 
 Things I said to you 

 And I give it all away 
 Just to have somewhere 
 To go to give it all away 
 To have someone 
 To come home to 

 This is my december 
 These are my snow covered dreams 
 This is me pretending 
 This is all i need 

 And I just wish that 
 I didn't feel 
 Like there was 
 Something I missed 
 And I take back all 
 The things I said 
 To make you feel like that 
 And I just wish that 
 I didn't feel 
 Like there was 
 Something I missed 
 And I take back all the things 
 I said to you 

 And I give it all away 
 Just to have 
 Somewhere to go to 
 Cive it all away 
 To have someone 
 To come home to 

 This is my december 
 This is my time of the year 
 This is my december 
 This is all so clear 

 And I give it all away 
 Just to have somewhere 
 To go to give it all away 
 To have someone 
 To come home to
